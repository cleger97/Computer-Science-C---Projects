### Computer Science C++ Projects

C++ projects for Computer Science classes.

Project 1 - Manhunt - Miniature maze finder game. Input the coordinates of both the target and the start of the player then you attempt to find the target. 

# Uses basic I/O, Arrays and strings in order to run the game.

Project 2 - Exploding Kittens - Code for a text-based variant of the Exploding Kittens card game.

# Uses file input to get the card data and vectors to store the cards.

Project 3 - DNA Sequencer - Code for a small-scale version of a DNA sequencing algorithm. Takes in trinucleotides and returns the amino acid variants and counts other versions of it.

# Uses vectors of pointers and allocates memory on the fly using file input in order to create the list of DNA.

Project 4 - The Garden - Code that simulates a small scale of a plant garden. Allows you to plant different types of plants and simulate a month time to see how the plants are faring after a certain amount of time.

# Uses polymorphism to allow manipulation of the plants using base class methods.

Project 5 - The Grocer - A text-based runtime where you input 3 different files (a truck file, a delivery list file, and an item list file) and then simulates, based on various variables from the files, all of the deliveries given the capacities of the trucks and the # of items.

# Uses a templated queue in order to hold the items inside the trucks and vectors to hold the deliveries, items, and trucks.
# Uses file input to receive the truck data, delivery list data, and item list data.
